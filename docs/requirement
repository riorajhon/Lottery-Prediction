Data Collection & Storage:
- Ethical scraping of historical data from official Spanish lottery websites (e.g., www.loteriasyapuestas.es).
    • Euromillones • La Primitiva • El Gordo
- Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB.
- Automatic updates daily at 00:02 after each draw.
- Web scraping tools like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy, mimicking human behavior.

AI Prediction Models:
- Multiple AI models working collaboratively: Random Forest, Neural Networks (RNN/LSTM), Genetic/Evolutionary Algorithms, Bayesian Networks, and optionally Neuro-Symbolic AI.
- Hot and cold number analysis.
- Wheeling system for partial prize optimization.
- Monte Carlo simulations for expected value estimation on high jackpots.

Backtesting:
- Test models against historical data with performance evaluation.
- Large-scale simulation (may require distributed computing).

Betting Automation (Selenium):
- Automated login to official website without storing credentials (encrypted sessions or fresh login).
- Balance check before placing bets.
- Captcha handling via manual intervention or external service.
- Supervised bet placement with mandatory confirmation screen before finalizing.
- Save receipts/proof of bets.
