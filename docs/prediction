🔹 Step 1 — Data Preparation
Main numbers (5 numbers per draw)
Lucky stars (2 numbers per draw)
Draw date
Compute features for AI:
    Hot/cold numbers
    Frequency counts
    Gap since last appearance
    Pair/trio occurrence statistics
🔹 Step 2 — AI Models Setup
Use multiple collaborative AI models to generate combinations:
Random Forest
Input: historical features
Output: probability of each number appearing in next draw
Neural Networks (RNN/LSTM)
Input: sequential draw data
Output: sequence prediction probabilities for numbers
Genetic/Evolutionary Algorithm
Optimize sets of combinations based on probability scores
Generate multiple “candidate strategies”
Bayesian Network
Model conditional probabilities of numbers
Output ranked number combinations
Optional Neuro-Symbolic AI
Encode wheeling constraints or rules
Adjust combinations to maximize partial coverage
🔹 Step 3 — Wheeling & Strategy Generation
Take top-ranked numbers from AI models
Generate wheeled combinations to cover as many partial matches as possible
Label each strategy set with:
Predicted probability score
Expected small-prize coverage
🔹 Step 4 — Monte Carlo Simulation
Simulate millions of draws for each candidate strategy set
Estimate:
Expected jackpot probability (as score)
Expected smaller prize returns
This gives the client the “predicted expected outcome” for each generated strategy
🔹 Step 5 — Output / Reporting
For each new draw cycle:
Top N predicted combinations
Probability scores per number and per combination
Wheeling set suggestions for partial prize coverage
Visual charts for hot/cold numbers and expected value
🔹 Step 6 — Iterative Learning
After each draw, append new results to historical dataset
Retrain/update AI models
Generate updated predictions
Report differences in strategy output over time
