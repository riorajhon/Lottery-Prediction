read Euromillones database (sort: fecha_sorteo, -1, with skip,limit(100)) untill all data
loop all data
    make first data : 
        id: lottery object id
        Main numbers (5 numbers per draw)
        Lucky stars (2 numbers per draw)
        Draw date
        day(sunday, monday, tuesdy ...., satoday)
        
        Hot/cold numbers(upto 5)
        Frequency counts(every 50 main numbers and Lucky starts)
        Gap since last appearance
        Pair/trio occurrence statistics    
    and next number refer previouse data
and save this to DB

in build_euromillones_features.py
for Pair/trio occurrence statistics
with previouse main number and star calculate all available combinations(pair, trio)
and make data {pair/trio, appearance(date, gap)} like number history and save this to new model
loop all Euromillones and if exist pair/trio update or don't exist make new
 so on feature model don't need frequency items and pair/trio items
